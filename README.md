# circle

Circle is a Flutter application that demonstrates some uses of the flutter pixel-perfect native tool: CustomPaint
With it, we are building a Unit Circle (take a look on that) and applying some trigonometry to the thing

## Future 

### Stop animation on every remarkable angle

### Show inner

### Point out sin(a), cos(a) and tan(a) in the circle, not below

### Show onto the screen the formulae used to get to the results
